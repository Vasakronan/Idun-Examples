# Development Kit
When starting the ProptechOS Edge Connector development, Idun can also help you get going by setting up access, and a set of test devices. The device key and other secrets will be shared using [1Password](https://1password.com/) in a vault like the image below. Idun will invite you to 1Password. Accept the invitation, and after Idun has confimred your account and set up a shared vault, you can access your test device information.
